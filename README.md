## Analysis Overview

In this anaylsis, the adept data journalist Dana sought and helped create a dynamic web page that organizes and displays a collection of historical data on UFO sightings around the world. The development of this interactive website serves to increase awareness about the prevalence and underlying omnipresence of UFO sightings. 
Users of this webpage can easily filter extensive UFO sighting data to better understand just how common of an occurence they can be in a city near you. Dana hopes that the interactive nature and usability of this tool will promote and encourage increased citizen advocay and vigilance on possible UFO sightings.

## Summary


Despite the ease of search and overall functionality of this web page, there are some clear areas for improvement that would make this tool even more user-friendly. For example, the values entered into the string search fields are case sensitive in this current version which can surely cause users to miss out on existing and valid search matches. 

To alleviate this issue, we could allow more search flexibility by removing the exact letter case match required for those fields so that strings entered in those fields can register both capital and lowercase letters in order to display relevant and accurate match results. 

Another feature that would improve search accuracy and ease would be a drop down selection of the search criteria as opposed to a blank search box for filters. This would allow users without any prior background knowledge or interest in UFO sightings to interact more dynamically with the data as all the possible search values would be listed in plain view for selection.
